Aspiring Marketer
-----------------

A highly articulate, organised professional with an eye for detail and excellent interpersonal communication skills. Proactive, creative and tenacious I am able to analyse problems, manage and present information in a way that facilitates solutions and management decisions. Having spent a number of years as a senior health care professional I now wish to utilise my creative abilities and evolve my career in marketing. In support of this, I have gained a Level 2 qualification in Understanding Coding and am currently completing a Level 3 Data Technician Skills Bootcamp. As a passion project I have run a social media account for a small charity organisation creating graphics, implementing content strategies, analysing engagement data and identifying trends in consumer interactions. My nursing background enhances my ability to understand diverse audiences and communicate effectively. Armed with my academic knowledge from undertaking a Level 3 Skills Bootcamp, I am eager to merge my healthcare insights with creative strategies to engage and evolve my career in marketing.
